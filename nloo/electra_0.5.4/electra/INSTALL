                Installation notes
*********************************************************

The Electra package is written in C/C++, and it should be able to run on any 
Unix-like operating system. It has been developed under MacOSX, and at 
the moment it has been partially tested on i686-GNU/Linux and SGI-IRIX64
platforms.

---------------------------
 Packages required
---------------------------
IMOD (http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/) version 3.1.0 or greater 

Actually installation of Electra does not depend on IMOD.
IMOD is required in order to use the *_setup programs, which generate the data
needed for the resolution analysis. These routines call some programs from IMOD
to calculate and transpose the tomograms.
If you generate the data with your own reconstruction/reprojection programs,
then you do not need the *_setup programs, and IMOD as well.

---------------------------
 Compiling and installing
---------------------------
Only the source code is provided for the package, hence you need to
compile the code and install the executables.
The package is contained in a compressed archive with name
electra_x.x.x.tar.gz, where x.x.x refers to the version.
This archive, once unpacked, generates a directory called 'electra',
which contains all the files needed for installation.

You can follow one the two following procedures to unpack the archive: 
  gunzip electra_x.x.x.tar.gz; tar -xvf electra_x.x.x.tar
or 
  tar -xzvf electra_x.x.x.tar.gz

If you don't install the executables in a subdirectory of the tree
generated by the archive, then you can unpack it anywhere you want:
in fact, after completing the installation you can delete the directory
'electra' and all its subirectories.

To compile and install the programs, enter the directory generated
  cd electra
and type
  ./install_electra

A list of the accepted options is available by typing
  ./install_electra help

By default, the executables are installed in the subdirectory bin. 
A different location can be specified with the option bin_dir=[].
In any case make sure that the directory where the programs are installed is
referenced with the appropriate setting of environmental variables (tipically
the $PATH variable).

--------------------------------
 Cleaning up after installation
--------------------------------
After compilation and installation, if the binaries have been installed
elsewhere by using the option 'bin_dir=[]', you can safely delete the directory
'electra' and all its subdirectories.
